Hello Fellow Beings!

I'm Dhanesha, a student pursuing her second MS in Analytics at Harrisburg University in Pennsylvania, USA. So far I've enjoyed all the courses I've taken and I've really gotten to learn a lot. Alongside, I also work full-time in Austin, TX. Since my relocation from NY to Austin, I've recently grown to like this place and I think I could call it my second home now! I love dancing, baking, hiking/traveling, swimming and am a budding freelance photographer.
